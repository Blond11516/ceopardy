== Setup

=== Display

You need at least 2 outputs: one for the game host for control and one for the
public.

At NorthSec 2017, we used 3 outputs because we didn't have the proper gear to
duplicate the public output for a stage monitor. There is a script in
`helpers/` that will set 3 outputs using `xrandr`. It didn't work with a GUI
tool when we tried at that time.
